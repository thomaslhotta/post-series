== Description ==

This is the long description.  No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
Markdown parsed.

A few notes about the sections above:

*   "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.org/wp-plugins.org usernames
*   "Tags" is a comma separated list of tags that apply to the plugin
*   "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on
higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable.
